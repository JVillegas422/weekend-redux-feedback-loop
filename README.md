## Project Name

# Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

_Duration: 7 Hours_

This project allows users to provide feedback by responding to various questions using a scale from 1 to 5. Once the form has been completed, the informtaion is submitted to the server and stored in a local database.

## Prerequisites 

- React
- Node
- Express

## Installation

1. To install, click the green `code` button at the top of this page. Fork and clone repo.

2. Create a database with the information listed in `data.sql` file. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly.

2. Open the project in a code editor of your choice and run the following command `npm install` in the terminal. It helps to have split the terminal in 3 tabs, with one being used for git add or commits. 

3. In the second tab you'll need to run `npm run server` 

4. In the third tab run `npm run client`. This will automatically open a new window with localhost.
